    dDescription:
    '"Amir''s Workshop" started in April 2020 at the peak of Covid-19 pendamic in Vancouver, Canada. The Work-from-home situation provided me with a golden opportunity.'
    'I didn''t have to commute to work and with extra couples of hours in hands, I could finaly start my dream: building my workshop from the ground up. A long overdue'
    'project that I have never had time to begin.'
    
    'Growing up at the hillsides of Alborz mountains in the city of Karaj, Iran, I always had access to my dad''s workshop, and I could run my projects at his shop. However, after'
    'moving to Canada, I left all those behind. And it was the time to start my own workshop.'
    
    'My childhood memories are full of fresh smell of woods, and the times that I used to play with my dad''s tools at his workshop. Discovering the use of tools was my favourit game.'
    'I admit, these serendipities weren''t always pain-free. Sometimes I used to hurt myself. However, later I learned, that my dad used to watch me from the corner of his eyes,'
    'and was ready to jump and save me, whether the situation was going out of contorl. When I pikced up some skills becoem more comfortable around power tools, he used to showed me'
    'tricks and techniques that I still use today. The first and the foremost lesson was to be PATIENT.
    
    'At some points, things become spontaneose and creativiy kicked in. I become a good observour the mother nature. Paying extra attentions to the harmony of the nature helped me to get'
    'inspired with my projects. I am  blessed to have access to the gorgeous forests of British Columbia, which helps thriving my inspiration and creativity.'
